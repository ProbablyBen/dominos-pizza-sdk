# DominosPizzaSDK
A C# SDK to interface with the Dominos Pizza API

**Todo**
* Add a txt file or directory with a dump of various example curl commands and responses that show the request/response payloads.  That seems like it would be helpful for reference.
* Maybe add some examples for how to use the SDK.
* Make this code suck less.
